## Background
Screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### Summary Statistics
• Mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume in each Drug Regimen

### Bar Charts and Pie Charts
• Total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study.
• Distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

### Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
• Final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. 
• Distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.

### Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
• Line plot of tumor volume versus time point for Mouse R554 treated with Capomulin.
• Scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

### Correlation and Regression
• Correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
